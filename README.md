# project3SAT-Solver
The boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is one of the oldest and still most important problems in computer science.
It is probably the most prominent representative of the P versus NP millennium problem. And its application is
widely used in many fields of computer science, e.g. theorem proving or software verification. The problem
statement is to check for a given propsitional formula if it satisfiable or not. A propositional formula is a collection
of variables combined by logical operators. These variables can be assigned to true or false. If there is at least one
assignment so that the resulting term is equivalent to the logical truth, we say that the formula is satisfiable. The
SAT problem is the task of determining for a given propositional formula if it is satisfiable. While noone was ever
able to come up with an efficient solution to this problem, it is comparably easy to come up with a basic solution.
In this project I have implemented such a basic solution (SAT solver) in C.
